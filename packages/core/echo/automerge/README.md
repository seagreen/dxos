# @dxos/automerge

Automerge adapter package

- Bundling automerge-repo to CJS
- Bundling automerge-wasm with vite to not require WASM and TLA plugins.
  - Consumers need to await `__tla` promise manually. See TLA plugin docs.
- Both esbuild and vite used to bundle different parts.
- When using automerge-repo plugins, one needs to alias `@automerge/automerge-repo` to `@dxos/automerge/automerge-repo`
